4 States of PDM (Project/Application Dependency Manager)

> Project Code - Developed source code, under version control

> Manifest file - Holds project metadata listing the depended upon packages to be managed
    *   All project metadata is available to be cached in the pull registry and can be extracted via HTTP API calls
    *   Our project will only pull from one registry, the Ford one.
    *   Filtration of garbage or malicious applications will take place at the registry level
     
> Lock file - Contains all the information to reproduce the full dependency source tree

> Dependency code - all source code named in lock file, arranged on disk such that the compiler/ interpreter
                    will be able to find and use it as intended, but isolated so that nothing can mutate it
        

These 4 States form a pipline, with each stage providing the metadata for the next.
